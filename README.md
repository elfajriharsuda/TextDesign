# Codecademy | Text Design
### codecademy project

In this lesson, you have learned that the way you design your text can have a huge impact on a users experience when browsing your site. Poor text design can make your site incomprehensible, and good text design can engage a user, make them more likely to buy something, and make them want to come back to your site.

You’ve learned that:

- Differentiating text is essential, and there are several ways to do this:
    - Use ``<h1>``, ``<h2>``, and ``<h3>`` header elements
    - Use 2-3 well-paired fonts, but no more.
    - Adjust font style, size, weight, spacing, and color.
- Whitespace plays a big part in readability. Make sure all of your text elements have enough whitespace.
- Use standard conventions for links and navigation buttons so users know what to expect.
- Use columns when necessary to keep line length at around 50-75 characters.
- Use colored cards to pair images with important text so users’ eyes are drawn towards it.
- Have the elements you want users to notice at the top of the page, or down the left-hand side because those are the areas of the page users will notice when skimming.
  
If you keep all of these tips in mind when you are designing the text on your site, you will have a much higher chance of getting users to read your content and navigate your site correctly.
